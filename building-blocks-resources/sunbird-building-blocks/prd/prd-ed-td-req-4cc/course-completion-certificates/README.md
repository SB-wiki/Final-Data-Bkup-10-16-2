# Course-Completion-Certificates

Introduction **Why Certificates?**

Teachers deem a certificate provided by a valid authority as an important artefact:

* serves as an evidence of completing a training
* collection of multiple certificates can potentially build teachers' learning profile
* permanence of the certificate since it is in a digitised format

Hence, the value of including this use case as an integral part of the teacher's online course journey. &#x20;

Further, awarding a certificate is a common mechanism used to recognise people with a set of skills and accomplishments:

* Helps to create a standard system of recognition across organisations. A certificate is recognisable and verifiable. It brings in _**Trust**_
* Helps teachers to showcase their skills and achievements to others to get a sense of _**Satisfaction**_ and _**Recognition**_ . It can also lead to material benefits such as, monetary rewards, promotions, recommendations etc.

* **User Personas:**
  * **Content Creator:**  Role which has access to create courses
  * **Content Reviewer:**  Role which has access to review and publish courses
  * **Course Mentor:**  Role which has access to create batches and monitor batches via course dashboard
  * **Badge Creator:**  Role which has access to create badges

All the above roles are envisioned as admin activities and hence typically are carried out by state admin or authorised personnel from SCERT office.

*
  * **User:**  End user who consumes the course - typically a state teacher
*   **System or Environment:** &#x20;

    * Admin related functionalities - course creation and review, batch creation and monitoring of batches - are designed to work on desktop/laptop form factor. Consumption experience is designed to work on mobile, tablet and desktop/laptop form factors.

Requirement SpecificationsThis section consists of requirement specifications for specific use cases in the User JTBD. The requirements for each use case are elaborated in detail through sub-sections for:

* Use case overview
* Overall process workflow
* Associated user stories&#x20;
* Non-functional requirements
* Localization requirements &#x20;
* Telemetry requirements
* Dependencies
* Impact on other products
* Impact on existing data &#x20;

Issue of Course Completion Certificate - OverviewThis use case is related to providing a course completion certificate to a user who has completed a course, if there is a certificate associated to it. Once a certificate is associated to a course all the batches created for that course within the tenant inherit the certificate. This certificate is a digitized completion certificate equivalent of an existing paper certificate which can be accessed from the user profile page.

**In-scope for this use case** There are broadly two types of certificates:

_Digital certificates_ - certificates which are based on the principles of verifiability and portability

_Digitized certificates_ - pdf certificates which are equivalent of a paper based certificate which the users can download

The scope for this use case is \*\*'Digitized Certificates'. \*\*

Epic JIRA Ticket ID[SB-11097 System JIRA](https://browse/SB-11097)

User Story 1: Assertion of certificate to a course - OverviewMain ScenarioAssertion of a certificate to a course will be done using a API from the back end. API will be used to carry out the following functions:

1. Associate a certificate to the course2) Update existing course certificate 3) Remove association between certificate and the course

These certificates will be modelled after the physical certificate currently issued by the state and will comprise of the following components:

| Name                  | Description                                                                  | Optional/Mandatory |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Issuer                | will be the state body issuing the certificate (organization or institution) | Mandatory          |
| Recipient             | will be the teacher who has completed the course                             | System populated   |
| Training program name | will be the name of the course which they have completed                     | System populated   |
| Signatory             | will be name of the individual signing the certificate                       | Optional           |
| Signature             | will be the digital signature image of the signatory                         | Optional           |
| Completion date       | will be the \<month, year> when the teacher completed the training           | System populated   |

**Mapping of the components**

* A state can have multiple unique issuers.
* Each issuer will have single signatory and signature.
* Each certificate will have a single issuer, signatory and signature.

The structural model for certification infra needs to be built on Open badges model and add extensions where necessary.

**Pre-requisites**

* Course is published
* Certificate template is available
* State has provided the details needed to assert the certificate
  * Issuing authority/Issuer name - The issuer will be an organisation or institution which is a competent authority to certify recipients. Note that the issuer is different from the signatory (i.e. the individual(s) who applies his/her signature to the credential).&#x20;
  * Signatory - will be the name of the individual/authority signing the certificate.&#x20;
  * Signature - will be the digital signature of the signatory.&#x20;

| 2        | Assert certificate to a course which already has a certificate attached      | Should fail with proper error message                  |
| 3        | Update certificate to a course which has a certificate attached              | The updated certificate will be asserted to the course |
| 4        | Remove asserted certificate to a course                                      | Asserted certificate will be disassociated             |
| 5        | Update/Remove certificate when no certificate is attached to a course        | Should fail with proper error message                  |

Exception Scenarios _**When the signatory changes?**_

In this scenario, the digital signature image is updated with the new signature image by the DIKSHA implementation team. The new signature image is provided by the state.

For Future Release

* As a badge creator, I want to assert certificates to courses created within my tenant so that users receive the certificate upon course completion.

Alternate ScenariosOnce a certificate is associated to a course all the batches created for that course within the tenant inherit the certificate. i.e., teachers enrolled into batches created by mentors from other tenant will not be receiving the certificates.

Exception Scenarios **Scenario 1**

If for some technical reason valid user(s) who should have received the certificate have not received it.

* All these user details should be captured and shared with DIKSHA implementation team on a daily basis by an overnight batch job
* DIKSHA implementation team to manually assert these certificates to these users

**Scenario 2**

Lets say a user has completed the course but for some reason has not received the certificate. However, before the certificate was manually provided to the user, the certificate was updated or removed.&#x20;

In this scenario, the user should still be provided with the certificate that was active when the user completed the course.

Wireframes

For Future Release(s)

* As a teacher, who'd want to enroll into courses, I want to be able to identify courses which offer completion certificates upon completion of the course so that I can decide whether to enrol into the course or not.
* As a state admin, I want to be able to ensure certificates are to be awarded ONLY to teachers from my state so that teachers from other states do not receive my state authorized certificates.
* As a state admin, I want to be able to view valid teachers who have not received certificates so that I can ensure that certificates are awarded to these teachers.
* As a teacher, I want to be notified via an email or mobile as soon as I receive the completion certificate so that I'm aware that I can now download my certificate.
